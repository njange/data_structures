Linked list - a data structure that represents a sequence of nodes. In a singly linked list, each node points to the next node in the linked list. A doubly linked list gives each node pointers to both the next node and the previous node.
node - a basic unit of a data structure, such as a linked list or tree data structure. Nodes contain data and also may link to other nodes. Links between nodes are often implemented by pointers.
head - a reference to the first node in a linked list.
tail - a reference to the last node in a linked list.
pointer - a reference within a data structure to another node or value within the data structure.
current - the node currently being looked at. Useful for iterating over a linked list.

#Process of creating a linked list:
1. Create a new node and allocate memory for it.
2. Assign the data to the new node.
3. Set the next pointer of the new node to NULL.
4. Set the head pointer to point to the new node.
5. Return the head pointer.
6. Repeat steps 1-5 until all nodes have been created.

#Process of adding a node to the beginning of a singly linked list:
1. Create a new node and allocate memory for it.
2. Assign the data to the new node.
3. Set the next pointer of the new node to point to the current head.
4. Set the head pointer to point to the new node.
